 <dl>What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
  <dd><li>W3C HTML5:</dd>
  <dd><li>Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li></dd>
  <dd><li>Published as a recommendation.</li></dd>
  <dd><li>Follows a more formal standardization process.</li></dd>

 <dl>Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</dt>
  <dd><li>Semantic markup refers to HTML elements that express the meaning of the content they enclose, such as header, footer, article, and section. Presentational markup was used to control the appearance of web pages with elements like font and center, but it is now deprecated because it mixes the content with its presentation. CSS is now used for layout and styling, as it separates content from design, allowing for cleaner code, better accessibility, and more flexibility in presenting the content on various devices.</li></dd>
 <dl>How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</dt>
  <dd><li>To check browser support for a particular tag or attribute, one can use online resources like Can I Use or the MDN Web Docs. These resources provide detailed information on the compatibility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features across different web browsers.</li></dd>
 <dl>What are the audio and video formats, officially supported by HTML standard? What happens if you use other format?</dt>
  <dd><li>The audio and video formats officially supported by the HTML standard include MP3, WAV, and Ogg for audio, and MP4, WebM, and Ogg for video. If you use other formats, the browser may not be able to play the media natively, and it might require additional software or plug-ins to decode and play the content.</li></dd>

    <p> for me, this was the most difficult understanding of the tasks, because the tk is described in insufficiently understandable language, because of this, I postponed the implementation of this work</p>
